### Week 01 - Feature Engineering and Feature Store:

 - [x] Keynotes

 1. **Feature Engineering** involves converting raw data from one or more sources into meaningful features that can be used for training machine learning models.

 2. **Feature Engineering Step** includes feature selection, creation, and transformation.

 3. **BERT** is Transformer-based pretrained language models that sucessfully capture bidirectional contexts in word representation.

 4. **Feature Store**: centralized, reusable, discoverable.
