-1,Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on  much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.  i returned it same day i received it  which was disappointing.,Blouses
-1,I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep  i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn't look so great on me either.,Blouses
-1,"I have been looking for a nice  white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5'2"") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back.",Blouses
-1,Looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person  runs very small. i returned it.,Blouses
-1,I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff  it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.,Blouses
-1,The cut of this piece is great  the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing  let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.,Blouses
-1,I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length  down for arm length ...,Blouses
-1,Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin,Blouses
-1,I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person  the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.,Blouses
0,This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.,Blouses
0,I love this shirt. tried in on in stores. i'm typically a medium across the board. i'm 5'6  137lbs  34d. i went for the size 6 figuring the 4 would be too small. the 6 fit... but it's short like everyone else said. not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short. i didn't buy it for the $50 price tag because of the shortness. but now that it's 30% i might spring for it  regardless of the weird cut. it's super cute otherwise!,Blouses
0,"My review of the pros : 1) quality made  not see through in any way  can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look""  really liked it. my review of the cons  which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2""  36 small c  broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs  which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2"")  this a a",Blouses
0,Like a baby doll top  with almost an empire waist going on.  feels comfortable and super flowy. i got a size m and i swing between m and l in most brands. the button stitching are a bit loose and will fray after some wears  i can tell. but i'm borderline on taking it back still because there are hidden side pockets! crazy--like it was a fluke or something. would fit a piece of paper or tissues. not keys or phones though.,Blouses
0,This top is beautiful in color and fabric. unfortunately just didn't work in the breast line. gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly. i'm not really large in the chest area (38b) but the large just didn't work. had to send it back.,Blouses
0,Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person  the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped  the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...,Blouses
0,I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder  like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however  the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top  you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight.,Blouses
0,I love this fabric  and the design details of this top. but i am only 5'3  and this top ends above my waist! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering. i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much  but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is. tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out  for someone without a perfectly flat tummy.,Blouses
0,"I'm 5'1"" and this top was too long for me. it's pretty but expensive for what it is.",Blouses
1,Love  love this tunic. my size 4 fits perfectly with a little room  material is very soft and very comfortable. could be worn with leggings or with a belt as a dress...so many options. so worth it!!!,Blouses
1,Great for the beachy business look. classy  but immensely comfortable. i feel like i look sharp without having to sit poker-straight.,Blouses
1,I'm so glad i bought this. the picture doesn't do it justice. it's lightweight  flowy and super comfy. i'll be wearing this all the time. very lightweight so it doesn't get hot. love the material  it's soft  light and flattering! color says light grey but it does have a bit of a blue/lavender hue to it as another reviewer said. i love cloth & stone and this is one of my favorites! well worth the money!,Blouses
1,The blouse is lightweight and is double layered  meaning a light layer over a lower layer. it's not bulky and not super flowy...just enough. i'm 5'1  a bit busty  and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great. it's figure flattering and not boxy. may be a tad short for taller women.,Blouses
1,Cute  simple top that completes an outfit all on it's own. it is pricey but i finally took the plunge and bought it.,Blouses
1,This is a great top to pair with jeans to step a casual night up a notch.,Blouses
1,I love this designer so i grabbed at this shirt immediately. unlike their other items  this shirt is linen. it's a great cut and very flattering once you iron it. the only problem i found was that as i wore it throughout the day  she shirt became wrinkled and misshapen to the point where it ballooned out around my stomach.,Blouses
1,Purchased in white. very pretty top. i thought it would be more lace - but non the less  it is lovely.,Blouses
1,I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it  so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!,Blouses
-1,It's pretty  floaty  feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes  to be safe  and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted  and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that  but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front  and one in the,Dresses
-1,I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but,Dresses
-1,"It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs  but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference  i am 5'7"" and 145lbs with 36"" 30"" 40"" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall  very good quality and beautiful",Dresses
-1,I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th,Dresses
-1,This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures  i had high hopes  but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say  it's going back!,Dresses
-1,"I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece  casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail  the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that  too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8"" 125 lb frame  and i ordered an extra small  and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back",Dresses
-1,This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one  but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.,Dresses
-1,I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on  but i did and found that  for me  the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).,Dresses
-1,On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.,Dresses
0,I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge  i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design.,Dresses
0,The xxs petite fit great except in bust and shoulder area. i'm a 32a and it was really tight.,Dresses
0,"Love the way this dress looks online. sadly  it doesn't look great on me. i'm 5'4""  athletic build. the small fit perfectly  but the extra fabric in the hip/pocket area just seemed to drag me down. i really wished this worked for me  but i think you've gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off.",Dresses
0,"I wore this dress for christmas and agree that it is beautiful (i received many compliments)  while i agree that this sweater dress is beautiful  i'm a little worried about the quality. after just a day of wearing it  it seemed to have lost it's shape. the bottom hem of the dress looked stretched out and it sagged slightly all over. i'm 5'7""  135lbs and my typical size is a m/4 and the dress fit perfectly initially  but not so much by christmas dinner. i'm not giving up on it because i was still",Dresses
0,I bought this jumpsuit in both fabrics. i adored the fit and feel of both  but sadly  the graphic fabric was not handled well in the construction. three examples: a thin white piece along one leg seam made it look like a hole; mismatched large pieces of white in the crotch area looked sloppy and wrong; worst of all  a diagonal was placed on both breast pieces  but they were different angles  which again looked sloppy and wrong in a place where you really want it to look neat and right. too bad b,Dresses
0,It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.,Dresses
0,This dress fit me like a glove and it's very pretty on  but the fabric looks and feels very cheap in person. it didn't look like a dress i spent this much money on. the lining is a very silky thick polyester that doesn't seem like it would be comfortable in any sort of heat. the lace overlay has this strange fusing kind of material between the pattern that looks so cheap. i love the idea of this dress  but it just isn't worth the money (in my opinion) so i returned it.,Dresses
0,This dress  it is heartbreakingly gorgeous  stunning. the entire idea and design is so gorgeous! the style with the sleeves  embroidery and slight shimmer at the top  two layers underneath  the dress is extremely gorgeous. i am so so so sad i could not keep it. i don't get why the sizes are so off here. i have come across so many clothes with gorgeous embroidery but too loose or too tight. i didn't want to send this dress back but it did not look good. it was just too loose. sad!!,Dresses
0,Just be prepared: this is huge! i looked hilarious in my normal 00p. this was in store  luckily  the the excellent personal stylist warned me. i also don't think the colors are as good in person - bit dull. if it fits you  it could be nice.,Dresses
1,I didn't expect to love this dress.. i assumed it would be something i'd return. this dress is so cute on! i love how well it fit me and that i could dress it up for work with booties  or pumps and a cardigan or dress it down for happy hour or a baby shower. i ordered a small ( i am 5'4 and 130 lbs) and it fit me like a glove....good job maeve you did it again!,Dresses
1,This dress is beautiful and unique but if you are more pear shaped get the correct size to fit your hips. it fits very close through the behind --but is stretchy. as i was putting it on and felt it hugging me closely  i thought it would never work - but when i looked in the mirror i found it looked quite nice even though it clings. and the stretch allows plenty of movement. if i size up to allow more room in the hips then i think it will be too loose on top. so i will just wear it with spanx. th,Dresses
1,I have been self conscious about a recent weight gain going from a size 6 to a size 10-12  but this dress makes me look & feel skinny again. i know people have suggested that vertical stripes help if you want to elongate your figure. it is true. thanks to this dress i look like my old self  and i am super comfortable wearing this all the time. you can wear this dress from day to night  you can dress this up or down. it looks great with a jean jacket and high-tops  or high-heeled booties with a n,Dresses
1,I am on the fence about this dress  as you'll see the reasons below  but it is really breathable fabric and extremely comfortable!  _________  pros:  - tons of stretch to the top part. i'm a 36c  so a lot of retailer tops are too snug for women with some bust. however  i fit into a medium here without it being too snug. you could actually go down or up depending on how loose or tight you'd like it to be on you.  - the bottom half  the skirt  feels so nice on the skin. very breezy. it is layered an,Dresses
1,Got this 4 days ago and have worn it 3 of those days. it is a perfect  beautiful autumn dress. the fabric is textured and slightly color-varied in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth. the fabric is a thin sweater knit -- because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does  nor would it be as figure-flattering. despite its thinness  it is still warm. would buy this in oth,Dresses
1,"Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available  i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall  140#  36dd  28"" waist  35"" hips  wide",Dresses
1,I tried this dress on in the store  and nearly bought it. other reviewers commented on the tight chest  but i must admit  this was the one part of the dress that fit like a dream on me. however  i am very small busted (34a). the waist is very flattering  as well. but  the skirt seemed to poof out at the wrong spots (namely  where the pockets are- i love pockets  but not when they create extra bulk at my widest points) and the skirt was about two or three inches longer than i would've liked. anyt,Dresses
1,"This is the perfect summer dress. it can be dressed up or down. the quality of the linen fabric is very nice. i'm 5'1"" and it hit right below my knees. i found it to run true to size. those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size  but the tie in the front can be adjusted. it's lovely.",Dresses
1,The color of this dress is just so beautiful - somehow both rich and airy! i believe this is meant to be a more relaxed fit  but that isn't quite my style. so to achieve more of a silhouette  i was lucky enough to stumble upon an xxs-p (petite) in store. i normally would never even try something on in this size  but it looked pretty generous so i decided to give it a try. so glad that i did! it gave more figure and i liked the length a bit shorter. with this dress  i think you can achieve the lo,Dresses
-1,This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs  ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering  and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed  and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi,Fine gauge
-1,I couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!,Fine gauge
-1,The fit was not flattering at all  but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.,Fine gauge
-1,I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side  so the garment flows nicely  it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial  heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey  not whi,Fine gauge

-1,"This is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.",Fine gauge
-1,As others have said  this is cropped  so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable  so i don't want to have to send it back.,Fine gauge
-1,I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first  the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.,Fine gauge
-1,The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style  it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.,Fine gauge
0,This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model  but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.,Fine gauge

0,This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning it.,Fine gauge
0,I'm not much for ponchos  but this one looked unique. it is thin  kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online   and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.,Fine gauge
0,I was so excited to receive this sweater in the mail since my local store didn't carry it. it is a very cute design if you have a smaller frame but i'm curly up top and it didn't lay they way it did on the model. there's plenty of stretch. unfortunately the fabric sheds and itches terribly. you could wear a shirt underneath but i'd have to wear a turtleneck so it'll be going back.,Fine gauge

0,Love the design with the buttons down the back but unfortunately this did not work for me. the colors were brighter than shown on the website which was my first disappointment  i prefer more muted colors. the second disappointment was the material. for me it was just too itchy. unfortunately  this one's going back.,Fine gauge
0,"I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine  and would be a great causal layering piece. however  there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam  and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention  unless you're built very narrow  the pockets will fall at  and accentuate hips  and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit  the layered style  with a cottony lined hood and ""faux"" lay",Fine gauge
1,"I ordered the ""red"" in a size xl. the fit is perfect--it matches the model's photos. the material is so soft. it's definitely a cozy fabric. the red color description is wrong but the photo accurately shows how it's really an orange shade. the color is cheery since it's bright. it will be great to use on cold days.",Fine gauge
1,This is such a classy  elegant and interest piece for your wardrobe. the fabric and cut is lovely and it drapes really nice. i love how it doesn't slide around on your frame when you move and the pockets are awesome - such a fun and practical extra. i thought the arms were a little tricky - but you would see the same issue with any cape style top. the gray is a nice color  but i wish it came in another option - a wine color would be amazing.,Fine gauge
1,"I was swayed to buy this via the reviews on the site -- and they are all correct! it is a beautiful piece. i got the ""brown"" colored one  but it is pretty much exactly the color in the picture  more of a khaki.     it is a gorgeous sweater. the sleeves are very long  but easy to push up if they're too much for you. it is also very long  which i prefer but on shorter gals it may be overwhelming. it's a perfect shell for cooler summer nights and it dresses up a basic outfit.",Fine gauge
1,As others have said  this is even prettier in person. beautifully made  colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium  depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large  it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.,Fine gauge

1,A successful first date sweater. the cut is flowy so don't expect snug. the quality is average for retailer sweaters  i guess nothing will ever be pill-free? the detailing at the bust reveals a little of what lies beneath  which in my case was just a bra but in more conservative environs might have to be a camisole.,Fine gauge

-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates

-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.,Intimates

-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return,Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates

-1,Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for,Jackets

-1,I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.,Jackets

1,This is a great lightweight jacket. i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things. it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear. i'm an anti-pant person. the only downside is the price. it's a nice stylish jacket  but not sure it warrants the high price tag. it also doesn't look to great buttoned up; has to be worn open. i do recommend it though.,Jackets

1,Ok  so by now  we know this is a cute top that is basically true to size but a little clingy. i prefer to wear it with a tank top or tee shirt underneath. it would also do well layered under something. for refernce  i am 5'7  about 120  and xs was the best fit.  but what i really wanted to mention is that i washed it in the machine on cold delicate and dried it on low  and it survived just fine!,Knits
1,This is a comfortable cardigan in a versatile color palette. size small fits a little snug in the shoulder area but other wise true to size. fabric is soft. great quality for the price!,Knits
1,Love this top. i have it in several colors and i'm waiting for the black to be restocked. it's somewhat sheer. perfect w my kimonos,Knits
-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.,Layering
-1,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,Layering
-1,I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off,Layering
-1,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,Layering
-1,This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.,Layering
-1,The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.,Layering
-1,"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though. the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference  i am 5'10""  130 pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need.",Layering
-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering
0,So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,Layering

0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

1,"If your looking for a nice quality basic tee  this is it. nothing special  but the fabric is a nice soft cotton with a little stretch. the cut is long and lean so i would highly recommend sizing up. i sized up from my usual medium to a large and it's still quite form fitting. i'm 5'2""  35a/b bust  28 waist  39 hips.",Layering
1,The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic  thin tank  but it's a good every day  wear all the time staple.,Layering

1,I'm in love with these tanks. so in love that i bought four of them (black  grey  blue  and the black motif). they are so flattering on. i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps. the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own  but also perfect for under a cardigan. i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer (which was made by velvet) several months ago and it was much more pricey. these are a much more affordable option.,Layering
1,I am usually a regular xs with retailer tops. i took a chance and went with the xxs in blue and am not regretting it. super comfortable top. fits perfect and will be great for work.,Layering
1,Love these tanks so much i have them in every color. i wear them layered under blouses  thermals  henleys  blazers  etc. i'm typically and extra small but the small fits perfectly.,Layering
1,This is great  lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down  or on a breezy day. it's sheer  so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model  which i like.,Layering
-1,I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.,Legwear
-1,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet,Legwear
-1,Adorable foxes  i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller  i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom  these were super snug. back to the store they went.,Legwear

-1,I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out  there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why  sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!,Legwear

-1,This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.,Lounge

-1,These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4)  they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug  short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off  these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!,Pants

0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.,Shorts

-1,I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much  right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl  having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life,Sleep
-1,These are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package  i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.,Sleep
-1,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down.,Sleep
-1,Length too long and waist to high. these are not sized for petites.,Sleep
-1,Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.,Sleep
-1,I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i've worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don't say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair  but i found the quality to be disappointing :(,Sleep
-1,I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,Sleep

0,This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.,Sweaters

-1,While the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!),Swim
-1,I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.,Swim

0,I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today  and while the fit was great  i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather  i'm sure. i liked them  but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive  i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work  but sadly  back they go.,Trend
0,I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful  but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single  good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.,Trend
0,"I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up  the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also  the actual neck part was tight. for reference  i am 5'3""  108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs.",Trend
0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.,Trend
1,This is such an ethereal flowing dress.more gray than light blue as it appears in pix.love the flowy bell sleeves.its a modest length just above the knee.quality a bit lower than is the retailer norm but still good.,Trend
1,I was on the fence about ordering this jacket  but i'm so glad i did. i got my birthday discount to help afford it. as the first reviewer said  the weight is substantial  but not too heavy  and the embroidery is beautiful! i have not worn this jacket yet  but i expect to get many compliments when i do! i usually don't wear jackets in this style  so it's a fresh  new approach for me....the embroidery takes it to the next level! it fits true to size. i usually take a medium  and the medium fits pe,Trend
1,I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small  but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine  yes  it is a little hard to zip up  but once on  it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling,Trend
1,This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.,Trend
1,This lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality. it is a substantial weight for fall  a deep vivid blue color  and just the right length to wear with boots.  it was a trifle snug in the waist. i would have kept it anyway  but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way.  at this price  it just wasn't right for me.,Trend
1,You just can't go wrong with a perfect white top. i'm usually xs or s and got this top in xs & the fit is perfect. the bottom is a very subtle bubble hem that you can't really see in the picture. the top is boxy but not too overwhelming since the proportions are just right. thesis a great transitional top that will go with skinny jeans  pencil skirts or even a pair of utility pants. it can easily be dressed up or down.,Trend
1,Fantastic quality. i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices. the fit is tts. i am smaller on top than the bottom and size 2 fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material  32-24-36. i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design. i couldn't tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit. i rea,Trend
1,Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.,Trend
1,"I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8""). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!",Trend
