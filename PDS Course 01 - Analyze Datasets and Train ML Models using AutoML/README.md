### Week 01 - Explore the Use Case and Analyze the Dataset:

 - [x] Keynotes:

 1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** mimics human behavior.

 2. **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that uses statistical methods and algorithms that are able to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

 3. **Deep learning (DL)** is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data.

 4. **AWS SageMaker** 

- [x] Week 01 Notes: [Week 01](./Week_01/C1_W1.pdf).

- [x] Week 01 Assignment: [Week 01 - visualize dataset](./Week_01/C1_W1_Assignment.ipynb).

### Week 02 - Data Bias and Feature Importance: 

 - [x] Keynotes:

 1. **Statistical Bias**: Training data does not comprehensively represent the underlying problem space.

 2. **Statistical Bias Causes**: Activity Bias, Societal Bias, Selection Bias, Data Drift/Shift, ...

 3. **Class Imbalance (CI)** measures the imbalance in the number of members between different facet values.

 4. **Detecting Statistical Bias** by AWS SageMaker DataWrangler and AWS SageMaker Clarify.

 5. **Feature Importance** explains the features that make up the training data using a score. How useful or valuable the feature is relative to other features?

 6. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** 

- [x] Week 02 Notes: [Week 02](./Week_02/C1_W2.pdf).

- [x] Week 02 Assignment: [Week 02 - Detect data bias with Amazon SageMaker Clarify](./Week_02/C1_W2_Assignment.ipynb).

### Week 03 - Use Automated Machine Learning to train a Text Classifier: 

 - [x] Keynotes:

 1. **Data Prepreration** includes Ingesting & Analyzing, Prepraring & Transforming, Training & Tuning, and Deploying & Managing. 

 2. **AutoML** aims at automating the process of building a model.

 3. **Model Hosting**. 

- [x] Week 03 Notes: [Week 03](./Week_03/C1_W3.pdf).

- [x] Week 03 Assignment: [Week 03 - Train a model with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot](./Week_03/C1_W3_Assignment.ipynb).

### Week 04 - Built-in algorithms:

 - [x] Keynotes

 1. **Built-in Alogrithms** in AWS SageMaker supports Classification, Regression, and Clustering problems.

 2. **Text Analysis Evolution**: Word2Vec (CBOW & Skip-gram), GloVe,  FastText, Transformer, BlazingText, ELMo, GPT, BERT

- [x] Week 04 Notes: [Week 04](./Week_04/C1_W4.pdf).

- [x] Week 04 Assignment: [Week 04 - Train a text classifier using Amazon SageMaker BlazingText built-in algorithm](./Week_04/C1_W4_Assignment.ipynb).
