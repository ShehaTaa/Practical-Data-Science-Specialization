## [Course 01: Analyze Datasets and Train ML Models using AutoML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/automl-datasets-ml-models?specialization=practical-data-science)

### Week 01:

 - [x] Keynotes:

 1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** mimics human behavior.

 2. **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI that uses statistical methods and algorithms that are able to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

 3. **Deep learning (DL)** is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data.

 4. **AWS SageMaker** -->

### Week 02: 

 - [x] Keynotes:

 1. **Statistical Bias**: Training data does not comprehensively represent the underlying problem space.

 2. **Statistical Bias Causes**: Activity Bias, Societal Bias, Selection Bias, Data Drift/Shift, ...

 3. **Class Imbalance (CI)** measures the imbalance in the number of members between different facet values.

 4. **Detecting Statistical Bias** by AWS SageMaker DataWrangler and AWS SageMaker Clarify.

 5. **Feature Importance** explains the features that make up the training data using a score. How useful or valuable the feature is relative to other features?

 6. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**
