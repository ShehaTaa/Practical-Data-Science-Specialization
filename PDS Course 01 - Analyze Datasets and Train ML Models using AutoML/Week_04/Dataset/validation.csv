__label__-1 "i wanted to love these they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity . i 'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store ."
__label__1 "i got some nice things for christmas but this ( along with the matching leggings ) was hands down my absolute favorite gift ! so stylish so cozy the perfect length to cover your bottom the perfect fit ( 38dd and ordered an xl ) love the pockets i could go on and on . the perfect set to lounge around the house in . sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them . when i say it is the perfect fit it is oversized ( not huge ) but it is roomy and that 's how i like it as loungewear ."
__label__0 "i 'm 4'10 and 105lbs .. 32c and hippy ... i ordered the 00p and 0p .. bc i 'm curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okay .. could n't justify the price . it 's a beautiful dress in the green color . the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break .. but if it fit i would 've overlooked it .. the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it ... i would 've had to have it sewn shut ."
__label__-1 "so i 'm not sure if its just my body type or what but this did nothing for me . the bottom which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium ( i 'm a size 8 bottom ) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose . i just think this one is going to take the right body type . it could look really beautiful on the right person just not me ."
__label__0 "i wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off . it stretched so much . i 'm going to beg my local store to take back . it should n't fall apart like that . it 's super duper cozy though ."
__label__1 "loved my . mustard colored ones so much i also bought the ligher green color . fit is wonderful- and very flattering . they can be dressed up or down . they look great with heals or booties !"
__label__0 "i was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed ! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top . it 's also see-through but i 'm not bothered by that . it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms . but overall i did n't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin . it 's going back ..."
__label__1 "so this dress is absolutely gorgeous ! my problem is i am 5'10 and it is very short wasted . between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain does n't work . i think if you are taller this dress just wo n't work . i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem ."
__label__1 "my favorite new dress . i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric . it 's very flattering and easy to wear ."
__label__1 "i saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design . however when i tried it on i personally found a few things that just did n't work for me : ____________ pros : - blue lace is lovely throughout nicely done . - there 's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups . i can only assume it 's to make it easier to get the dress on . it 's a nice little detail although not sure if really"
__label__1 "not long ago i bought a pair of hei hei pants that i love so when i saw these i immediately tried them on . i love them too . they are pretty and comfortable and i am so happy to get away from tight jeans ! they are also very flattering . size wise i find that i have to size down with hei hei perhaps because they have a looser cut ."
__label__1 "yes ! i love the color the fabric and the fit up top . the skirt however is very poofy . i am going to let it hang for awhile ( it was an online order ) and see if some of that relaxes . otherwise i will need to return it ."
__label__1 "could n't resist the polka dots ! very cute and stylish cardi . since i 'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me . i tried on the xs and small and while there was n't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room . it 's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase !"
__label__1 "i never buy shorter shorts my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering but these were actually ok. they did n't look loose like the model but hit a nice spot on the leg and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely . i even bought the white color ... unheard of ! i weigh 115 lbs all legs ..."
__label__0 "i was disappointed by this dress . i listened to the reviews and ordered one size up a size 6 instead of my usual 4 and that was the correct size . fit like a glove . unfortunately the style left much to be desired . this dress is very costume-y . i felt like a wench from the renaissance fair . not a good vibe . it is a beautiful dress i 'm not denying that but not as a dress you would actually wear to an event . there 's just too much going on with the tapestry look and the many types of fabric . i a"

__label__0 "i am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit . if you 're a true xs i 'd skip this one . however if you are able to size down i think it would look really great !"
__label__1 "this could worn with anything . tank top long sleeves gloves jeans and pants . very high quality material . will be a staple in my wardrobe this fall ! ! !"
__label__1 "i bought a size small ( 5 ' 6 & 130lbs ) . it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much . i ended up looking hippy with no butt . the material is nice and it is a nice quality . i just did n't have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area ."
__label__0 "o.k . i soo wanted to love this dress . if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely . i am slim and tall 5 ' 9 but am large chested . a 36d i usually wear an 8/10 so bought a 10. it was too tight around my chest and back . so i went up a size to a 12. it was better but not exactly comfortable . i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back . the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it would n't solve my issue ."
__label__-1 "love this top ! it 's pretty unique and well made . i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look ."
__label__1 "i 've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one ! ! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size ( small ) . i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store . it 's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it . you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings ."
__label__-1 "i love the idea of this top but there is just way too much fabric involved in person ! i 'm 5 ' 2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest . i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering . i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it . i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back the silhouette is nothing like shown . if there were just less fabric i wo"
__label__0 "i am normally a m-l ( 170 lbs 5 ' 4 34dd ) . i ordered this top in a medium knowing it ran big and it is huge . seriously i could wear it as a dress . i like the whole loose and comfy top thing but this is so massive it looks sloppy . i 'm going try and return it for a small . hey i like that i can wear a small ! the green color really is pretty and it 's so soft . just need a much smaller size ."
__label__0 "in the photo this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing . i am 5 ' 7 always take a size medium but on me the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just did n't fit properly . the collar does n't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly . if you try to use the button it stretches and looks terrible . in the back it falls short . it 's going back ."
__label__0 "this is a pretty dress although it runs smaller and the colors are n't as vibrant as on the website . the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure . this probably will look very nice on someone smaller ."
__label__0 "... maybe i would 've kept this top . i love the print colors and design . however i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it . since my bust and torso seemed too large for it the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good ."
__label__-1 "i received this dress in the mail yesterday . right away i noticed the coloring was n't quite the same as it appears in the images online . in person the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny as opposed to more muted . i was willing to look past that but then i tried it on . i ordered a small which is my typical size in retailer dresses . it ran quite large and was way to long for me ( i am 5 ' 4 '' ) . overall between the coloring and sizing this dress was n't a hit for me ."
__label__1 "this top is simple but beautiful . i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl . it is a swing top but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing . i am around 5 ' 6 and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all . i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks . the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like . a great staple for your closet ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress and ordered it online . i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point . ultimately i decided to return it as i could n't justify spending $ 178 on a dress that did n't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer ."
__label__0 "i 'm not in love with this but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price is n't bad so i 'm keeping it . i got it in s and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops ( 34b 26 inch waist 120lbs ) . if i had gone with xs it probably would 've been too tight in the shoulders . however i could be 6 months pregnant and you would n't know it . it is very boxy in the torso and i realize the design is for it to be flowy as the back is partially split . but it looks relatively fitted on the model which is"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this dress . i need it for a wedding and i thought i had hit the jackpot . the dress arrived with a small tear . the seams are puckered and badly seen . for an almost $ 300.00 dress the quality is terrible . i expect better from retailer . i 'm so disappointed ."
__label__0 "on the picture shows the belt.does n't come with the belt ."
__label__0 "when you buy a dress full price and it goes on sale before you can even wear it ( $ 168 down to $ 49 ) uuuuggghhh ... i like the dress fine enough but it has a weird under wire it makes my chest look strange like i do n't fill it in . i usually do n't have that problem as a c cup . more orange/red then yellow as well . would n't recommend ."
__label__0 "not that i do n't recommend only do n't recommend if you have muscular thighs . so i tried on the small in plaid pattern ( or checkered ? ) and not flattering on me at all . snug on the though and loose by the knee and below . also that pattern made my legs look weird no kidding kind of crooked ... they are super comfortable and the small fit so perhaps they run small ? i would get petite if you are usually a petite the regular size bunched on the bottom too long . i am usually a 0p or 00p or"
__label__0 "i loved these when i first got them . they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i 've ever owned . plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy . unfortunately they stretch out horribly within one wearing . for such a pricey pair of cords i 'm extremely disappointed . i 'm not sure if i should 've sized down but now i 'm wishing i had although i 'm not sure that would make a difference ."
__label__0 "i really like the pattern and the cut of these pants . the fabric is nice too . however i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first ( and only ) time i wore them . i am 5 ' 6 and about 150 lbs . i ordered size 10 ; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much ."
__label__-1 "while the print is cute the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller . the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model ( it rides up under your boobs ) and the whole cup area tips forward - it 's not really molded like a bra more flat foam insert . immediately went back . hopefully if retailer continues to do swimwear they 'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they 're also workable for fuller cup sizes ( underwire please ! )"
__label__1 "i went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews but i should have ordered my own size as they 're a bit loose around the waist . the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering so i definitely recommend them !"

__label__0 "these sleep pants are very pretty soft and comfortable . unfortunately after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price . i do n't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i 'm not so sure . i guess if you do n't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what 's the point of buying them ?"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this jacket . so soft and great color . unfortunately it is just too light weight . it is almost like shirt fabric . nice heft to the fabric though . nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me . i am 5'10 and 135lbs . the small was the right size . i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer ."
__label__-1 "i should have paid closer attention to the other reviews . i could barely get this blouse over my head ! after getting it on the armholes too are very small . the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie . i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck . i tried the small but think a medium would n't have been much better . it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves . i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair . if you have a tiny head and pencil a"

__label__1 "i paid full price for these gladly ( the olive ones ) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale . they are midweight soft flattering and stylish . they stretch a little ( belt needed ) but not much . pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park . i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather !"

__label__0 "like a previous reviewer i love white blouses -- nothing better . also love polka dots so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on . quality is good ; nice material . maybe a little heavy for summer . but it really did n't work on me . i normally wear a small in tops however with a 34d chest ( 5 ' 5 122 lbs ) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest . this does not gap but it just hangs on me . if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t"

__label__-1 "i usually like coats and wraps with high-waisted belts but this way too high and the fit was really unflattering . i can see it being chic on a tall slender person but it 's definitely not right for my short curvy body . returning it today ."
__label__1 "love these ! loose and comfy everywhere . delighted to have found a 32 and delighted that they are roomy even at the waist . i exchanged another pair of pilcro 's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict but as usual retailer customer service was excellent . earlier sale price was honored easy returns in the orignal shipping bag .. retailer design fashion and company attitude excels !"

__label__1 "what can i say ? this is a winner ! it is stunning gorgeous a perfect summer dress that looks like sunshine and orange sorbet . it is classic early 1960s look which is exactly my style ! i am usually a 14 or a 16 so i went with a 16 based on the reviews and it fits divinely . i do n't need another orange dress but this is a keeper !"
__label__1 "i purchased this shirt in black . luckily it was on sell . it can be dressed up or dressed down . it 's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans . i got it on sale too . i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style ."
__label__-1 "when you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress the stripes are diagonal . however that is not the case with the dress in person . the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering . such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation . alas not very flattering so back it goes ."
__label__-1 "disappointed : - ( this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me . i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me . bummer ! i liked the quality and weight ( not too heavy nor too light ) but shape is unflattering . it 's going back ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy . it is n't it is very heavy much too heavy for florida heat . the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down . i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance easily . back it went boo hoo . if you are between sizes i would size down runs a bit big ."
__label__1 "this top is light and airy but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach . its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit . i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit . it runs slightly big but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless . the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special ."
__label__-1 "super cute dress online on the model . what you ca n't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight . it might be my body type . otherwise it 's super cute in person and i wish it would 've fit better !"
__label__-1 "unfortunately does not look anything like in the picture . looks like an oversized house robe . i expected much more but was disappointed . i am definitely returning it ."

__label__1 "this fit me perfectly with a little room but think it 's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off . this feels like a dream and is very good quality . definitely a heavier piece but i like that . it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy . the back is adorable too ! retailer hit it out of park with this one ! grab it before it 's too late ! i 'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly"
__label__1 "perfect in every way- easy to wear-very feminine comfy and goes with everything . only problem is color is not like picture . it is a mauve not a light pink . i still love this top and the color it camre in . brighten up with lipstick- necklace- earrings- whatever your pick . highly recommend . a winner ! ! !"
__label__0 "super soft super cute but too short for a dress too long and too overwhelming for a shirt and did n't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i 'm returning . love the colors feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional ... having said that .. fits tts i guess ."

__label__-1 "i really wanted to like these but they just did n't look right on my 5 ' 3 sorta bulky frame . i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings so maybe i 'm just not the right target for these but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try . the waist was too high for my liking and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look ."

__label__-1 "i loved them on when i got them but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them and i had them on no more than 5 times . it was not a fit issue or a seam issue ; they literally just frayed apart in two areas . while flattering and incredibly comfortable the fabric was not at all durable ... they are not your typical denim they almost kind of a knit feel them ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in the plum color which in real life just looks like a very very dark brown . that would probably be okay but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements . i ordered the regular length but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh ... way way too short . i am 5 ' 5 for reference . lastly i think the fabric is just awful quality especially for this price point . the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou"
__label__1 "this . an unexpected purchase ... i found this on my way to the dressing room . the fit is stunning . i sized way down ( i.e . normally wear 10/12 curvy and bought a small ) . it accentuates my curves and is incredibly flattering . i bought the navy and will be adding another color soon ! the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy . it 's a nice addition to my work wardrobe ."
__label__0 "while i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it ! i mean it was truly laughable ! do n't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board ."
__label__1 "warm cozy can dress down/up and is perfect for traveling . a great staple . as other people noted the dress ( if you buy your regular size ) is a little more fitted than it looks on the model . size up if you prefer it to hang looser ."
__label__1 "this top is so flowy and has a great fit ! i can see wearing it lots of different ways . it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down ."
__label__0 "unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re : dry cleaning only but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker . it did fit well -- i am 5 ' 2 32c 107 lb and the xs petite fit very well definitely form-fitting not long in the arms or waist . the grey heather design was not my favorite look actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest and it looked like i had a huge dark stain ."
__label__0 "i tried this on at the store and though it was pretty i was a little underwhelmed . it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up . the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking . the idea of the top was better than the execution ."
__label__-1 "this sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it . and without a chunky statement necklace it looks like your grandmothers apron . there just is n't any style to it - has to go back ."
__label__-1 "such a cute pattern and i loved the fold-over design but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage ! i should 've looked more closely at the photo - it 's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage . a couple more inches of fabric would 've really helped . i 'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with . i could maybe wear them around my husband but definitely not my dad ! i felt like if i bent"
__label__0 "the material deep color and design are gorgeous . however the dress is just too bulky for my 5 ' 2 and 110lb frame . i ordered a 0p and it just was n't flattering on me . it 's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it 's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am . i 'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 6 and it hits me at mid-thigh . the top ( black/camel version ) is sheer enough to need a cami . the waist is quite high . not flattering for me -- the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant -- plus i do n't want to deal with having to wear a cami ."
__label__1 "love this coat - great fall piece ! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture . great retailer purchase !"
__label__1 "i love this dress ! it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim . it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size 6 but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size 6 dresses . i am 5 ' 8 small busted and a pear shape so i like the more fitted style of the top with the a-line skirt . i love the length hitting just below the knee . it is flattering for my body type . seems well made and at a good price point ."

__label__0 "this is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i did n't find it to drape well on me . it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric . i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps . the style and design of the dress is great though . for reference it did fit fairly true to size . i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well . if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress ."
__label__0 "the white is completely sheer . i am so tired of see through shirts ! ! even at the sale on top of sale prices i would n't recommend this shirt . if the fabric were n't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back . but it just looks silly with a tank top under it the cotton just does n't lay right ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt ! it 's such a beautiful striking color yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight . the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute . i bought another one of these when it went on sale . so now i have two just in case ; ) haha"

__label__1 "so i love this top . i got it in black and red . both are amazing and go with about anything . they run a bit large . i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck . i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry . i would say it shrunk 10 % at most . beyond that no difference . in fact it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big . obviously if you do not dry clean this you are going against manufacturer recommendations but i"

__label__1 "really cute top comfy with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit or worn just casual . not clingy at all ... in fact maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color ! i typically wear a large but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down ."
__label__0 "i absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them . the fit is flattering they are a perfect long length and the colors are stunning . after several wears it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry . i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together . after a lengthy ironing session i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu"
__label__-1 "i washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt . i dried it on medium . i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly . i loved the color ( lilac ) . fit and style when i received it and immediately put it on . so sad about the shrinkage . for a $ 58 shirt i expected a bit more . retailer should suggest air drying the shirt . so bummed and disappointed ! ! ! ! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time ."
__label__1 "i saw this online and then at the retailer store where i was able to try it on and was happily surprised.yes it is way oversized but if you size down it will work best . i have narrow hips and shoulders but a 34 dd bust so fit is not always easy . because of my shape i normally wear a medium or small but had to size down to an xs petite in this . you may find as i did that it works dressed up or down . if i had bought a regular size and were lots younger it could have worked for a dress with tigh"
__label__-1 "i have been continually disappointed in retailer 's clothing for the past year . i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so but dresses like these somehow make the cut . it does not make sense . since when did retailer exclusively market to older women ? no retailer 's market has always been young adults . this dress is extremely matronly . although the bottom print is nice the hot pink belt ? ? is completely mismatched and gaudy . i really hope retailer starts curating better dress"
__label__0 "wish this worked for me ! i am 5 ' 9 '' . it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot . the neck was kind of tight on me too . i love the idea of this dress but need it longer . the dress is very roomy overall ."
__label__1 "these are so cute ... i went into the store to buy something else and came out with these . i usually wear a 10 and bought a medium . these are also lower price than i expected . also well constructed . thank you antho ! !"
__label__0 "i ordered this top in 2 colors because i thought it would be great with leggings . i always love my retailer purchases but this fell a little short . i think it may be the type fabric it is but the way the back hangs so low on my frame ( 5 ' 4 ) it does n't drape nicely over my leggings . the style of the top is very cute and maybe if i wanted it for skinny jeans it would be ok. i returned them both to the store . this is one that would be better to try on first ..."

__label__0 "i wanted to love this top ! on me it was weirdly boxy . it was too wide and too short and it was more sheer than i expected it . the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly . i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has . i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy . unfortunately it will be going back ."

__label__0 "i think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i do n't know how i would use this top . i do n't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops ( if people see my bra slightly so be it ) but this is really sheer unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this and in my mind that defeats the purpose of a lightweight sleeveless top . i returned it and was sorry to have to do that ."
__label__1 "these are beautiful and very comfy . they do run very large . i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small . the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results . the description needs to be updated to reflect this ."

( i 'm an xl usually and the fit was tts ) the only thing i 'm not crazy about is the slip it 's more of a flesh toned color . i 'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these retailer !"
__label__-1 "tried this on in store . was ill-fitting and sheer ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this top . love the mix of fabrics and patterns . but it is too short for a tunic length . i should have paid attention to other reviews . i 'm about 5 ' 8 '' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length is n't right ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt except that the hook that keeps it close does n't work a lot outside of that i love it . i typically wear a small or extra small and with this shirt the extra small was perfect ."

__label__1 "i love this sweater it 's so soft and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it . it runs true to size but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more it seems to stretch a little . overall i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it !"

__label__1 "this pullover is great for lounging ! so warm and cozy !"

__label__1 "feminine and lovely flutters indeed . i am on the fence . i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right . given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear ."

__label__1 "the photo does n't do it justice . the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans . texture is light and gauze-y but i do n't find it too see-though . sizing was tough- i 'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s and went with the xs on this ( ordered both to try ) sacrificing some length for a more flattering width . great for the sale price ! ! !"

__label__1 "this sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph . definitely size down . honestly i kinda love it anyways ! the inside is so very soft and it 's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day !"
__label__0 "i like this top . in the photo the white in the print stands out . in-person the white areas of the print ( not embroidery ) is dull more like beige . the flowers and embroidery itself looks good the print looks good . it is a swing top looks better on a slender frame . such loose fitting tops just do n't look good on my curvy frame . i sized down could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted . i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops ."
__label__1 "i 'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress as it 's taken a beating in the reviews ! i measure 34 ( a ) -27-35 and have no problems with the size s fit at all . it 's drapey but not voluminous with no pulling at the hips . the folded detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders but not in a bad way . the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest and the red pattern/palette is awesome . love the length too -- i am 5 ' 4 & the size s hits me just above the knee ."
__label__-1 "i should have listened to previous reviewers . but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures . when it arrived in the mail i realized this is a mistake . it has no shape material is poofy and feels cheap . it is going back ."
__label__0 "i love the style of this top . i just wish there were a slimmer version of it . unfortunately this top does n't suit my long slim midsection . it is so wide it completely hides the waist . i think it would look adorable on a different body type ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 3 and 120 lbs . i ordered a m and it was far too boxy and long in the arms as well as the back . the collar is small and lays flat . the material is good quality and soft but heavier than i had hoped ."

__label__-1 "really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front bottom ... backside was perfect coverage ... also most important this top is see-through ! item as pictured is not accurate !"
__label__1 "i was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog . when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size i tried it on . it fit so well - the front was n't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps . i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends . i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging . i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well . the fabric is silky but washable . the top is very well made and fun to wear ."
__label__-1 "i loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them . unfortunately after washing the turquoise one it sprang several holes . the same thing happened to the second one after one wash ! i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer and they have washed and worn great . i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately . very disappointed ."
__label__0 "i really want to love this dress the style and colors are so nice and easy . i like the loose flowy feel of the dress . it runs a tad large but that is part of the style . what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress . also it has lining which is nice for modesty but with the stiff/itchy factor mixed with lining it feels a bit cumbersome . i have n't decided if i will k"

__label__-1 "i was so excited to buy this coat since i missed out on buying the last one . i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket ( i 've borrowed my friends ) . i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body . it 's disappointing considering the price you pay . i would return if it still had tags on ."
__label__1 "really like this tunic a lot . it is comfortable and easy to throw on and look put together . i 'm always a fan of pockets too ! i ordered the xs -- i 'm 5 ' 4 about 118 # . it fits loose but not in a bad way . the fabric allows it to fall well over the body . if you are tall it will probably be too short for you as it was a few inches above my knees . glad to have snagged this right away ! more tunics like this please !"

__label__-1 "sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is . i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life . this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style . another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $ 5.00 ! ! !"
__label__-1 "i totally agree with the last reviewer . i 'm 5 ' 2 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders . the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i could n't move my arms . the small was better but was too big in the torso . the material itself was really nice . too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering ."
__label__0 "this is a pretty dress . i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit however the sleeves were too long . had to return as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me ."
__label__1 "i feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback -- this dress is killer ! it 's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan . it 's body skimming but lined so it does n't cling to flaws the knit itself is substantial and it 's a mockneck not a turtleneck . i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large . because of weight and lining this is a spring and early fall dress"
__label__0 "i had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it did n't met those expectations . the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt it is jus very plain . this item is being returned ."

__label__-1 "this is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear . this brand makes some of the softest cutest tees but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry . not worth the cost ."
__label__1 "this is a classic ! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60 's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style ! ! ! love it !"
__label__-1 "this sweater was a big let down . i am 5 ' 2 so i ordered it in a petite . it was so short that if i lifted my arms you 'd see my bra ! ! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms . and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic . the entire sleeve is just wide and it continues with little increase into the cuff . it is just short and boxy . it is going back for sure ."
__label__1 "i do n't own any peach outerwear because i did n't think it would complement my skintone . this cozy bomber proved me wrong . wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that 's eye catching . great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe . this is not a fitted style it 's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist just like a regular bomber jacket . i chose medium petite and it fits just right . i 'm a 36d 135 # 38-28-35 ."
__label__1 "this is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love . it is breezy and easy comfortable but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print . you can wear it with some cute flip-flops or polish it up with some cute boots ."
__label__-1 "as the other reviewer said the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous . i do n't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip . i 'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well . very very strangely constructed-i could n't keep it even at the deeply discounted price"
__label__-1 "i just received this in the mail today . first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer . the description says viscose lining so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color . second of all it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope . the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said . i ordered a size smaller than us"

__label__-1 "this was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity -- and especially at this length ! unfortunately this is a mess in terms of proportions . if a size 2 can barely get it off then there is a design flaw . sadly the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited about this top as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way . unfortunately this top feels like an old grandma 's polyester suit the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer . it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way due to the layered fabric . sadly going back ."
__label__1 "this dress is very versatile and i plan to use in all year round with some tights and boots in the fall/winter and strappy sandals in spring/summer . i originally purchased this dress in a m but had to size down for a more snug and flattering fit . the navy is much darker than the picture ."
__label__0 "i got the black in a medium . it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy . i think it 's the angled wide sides . on me the design just created bulk . nice substantial fabric but it is n't soft or cozy . back it goes"
__label__1 "i hope you can get this top.this is a great classic that will be in my closet for a long time ."
__label__-1 "this skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo . i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big but nothing that affected the look of the skirt . the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together almost like sunday school felt cut outs ( but stiffer ) ( not a fan ) .. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple and the color washed me out . definitely not worth the price ( for me anyways ) . good luck !"

__label__1 "this piece is gorgeous in person . it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything ... it is more of a coat than a sweater . i bought one for my mom and picked one up for myself when it went on sale . it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection ."
__label__-1 "the material is very nice . not flimsy at all which is nice . the problem was the fit around the arms . i am a petite person with a small chest but it still did n't cover me bra . i 'll be returning it ."
__label__-1 "these are a beautiful color but run large . i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me . they are very low rise so i do n't think i 'll be trying the smaller size ca n't even imagine them being lower . also they are cropped that 's hard to tell in the picture ."
__label__1 "love this jacket ! got my usual size medium and is perfect ! beautiful quality"

__label__0 "this fabric of this top is gorgeous . however i 'm 5 ' 5 and it hits in a really weird spot . right no the point of the hip that you do n't want to accentuate . you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans . sad i love the top 90 % of it ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these because of the side zipper but they zip in front even though the order listing and bag label called them wine side zip pants . they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material . what bothers me is that i was charged $ 5.95 to send them back even though the product description ( and the name before someone changed it on the website ) were wrong ."
__label__1 "i love the print of this dress ; the deep blue really is striking . i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore it 's hard to justify the price . i ca n't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering . still on the fence . . . it would be better as a sale piece ."
__label__-1 "i bought this dress in an xs and am 5 ' 4 115 lbs and fairly proportional . the shoulders were snug but the hips ( and maybe waist ) were at least 2-3x too big . comically so -- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side ."
__label__0 "the sweater is very very warm . it looks okay not the best but not bad . i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure i do n't wear sweaters and jackets without closures . i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder . so i am sending it back ."
__label__0 "these pants are cute . they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model . they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt . these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly . since they already run a bit big this is a major negative . i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home . by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants ."
__label__1 "love the dress but ended up returning it as i 'm not sure how often i would wear it . the only down fall is the dress is straight so you have to take smaller steps but stunning dress ! ! !"

__label__0 "this shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person . i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it ! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help ."
__label__1 "i can not say enough good things about this dress . as a petite person ( 5 ' 0 ) it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations but this dress fit perfectly . it 's also so well-made : the fabric is soft comfortable and gorgeously detailed and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume ( in a good flattering way ) ! i got it shortened by about 2 but this dress fits like a dream ."
__label__0 "i have several pairs of coh and love them all . when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them . however when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long . meaning they go well below your butt cheeks ( like 3 # which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they are n't they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh ! i thought perhaps it was my perception that day so i waited an"
__label__1 "i ordered this in xs i 'm 5 ' 4 around 115lbs and it fits perfectly . the material is very soft but not see-through and the romper is well-made . i wish it came in other colours i 'd buy more !"
__label__-1 "the skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it and was mostly white yellow and some red . the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me . the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return ."
__label__0 "this dress is such a crazy beautiful color the picture does n't do it justice . i ordered this right when i saw it and i almost love it . the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice but i just did n't find it flattering at all . the slip was n't the nicest but completely not a deal breaker . i did n't think it was overly flattering on the model either so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway but something about the way it 's cut is just a little off for me . it was very tru"
__label__-1 "it 's not a bad concept but i wished for more . i wish this tunic was a : different material as it was wrinkley and drop-waist design instead of at the waist . too bad . i wanted to love it but it will go back ."
__label__-1 "i ca n't believe the reviews this dress has gotten . i ordered it and was so excited to get it . when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone . while i love the color the quality just is n't there and its not worth the money even with the 25 % discount i used . the fabric is not thick in fact it is quite sheer for velvet . i honestly would n't feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this . second is the fit . i 'm 5 ' 6 32a xs on top 4 on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w"
__label__-1 "whatever happened to sizing ! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops . it is also unlined which is not a huge issue . i wore it with a cami . the arms were n't too gaping for me thankfully . i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides . i am 140 lbs and got the small . should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller ."
__label__1 "i love this top ! although it is a tad big i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big . however i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it 's too big .... hope that makes sense ! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair but the yellow was so pretty too !"
__label__1 "the fit and design are interesting . in the 00p the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required . the quality is fine . but the color was very blah with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme . that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused . with the lining and material weight it would be more a cold weather item only not an all seasonal dress . generally it was interesting but not a most come home wit"
__label__1 "very different . i love the unique design and it is appropriate for various settings ."
__label__0 "purchased the gray patterned top . seemed to fit tts but it did n't fit me . i 'm an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just would n't fit right around the shoulder/neck area . i 'm pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well . nice length all around ... top and sleeves ."
__label__0 "i love the way that this suit looked however i found that it was lacking in support . i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on that it just does not cover my butt . it fit elsewhere just fine but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking . in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area . i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top ."
__label__-1 "this was disappointing to me . i love how this looks on the model . unfortunately it made me look huge . it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on . i did n't find it was tts i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist . before i 'd even put it on i noticed the waist looked very small . i do n't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching . it 's like the buttons did n't match up or something ."
__label__0 "so this is just the most lovely romper . beautifully made flowey . very comfortable until you have to take it off . this is the review i posted on facebook . so no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror or maybe has not shared with me that moment when you can not get out of because it has turned into a straight jacket that otherwise cute romper . and again maybe a man invented it !"
__label__0 "i like everything about this shirt except i wish the embroidery was on the back too . gives it a cheaper look by only having it on the front . you will look prettier coming than going for sure !"
__label__1 "i tried these on in the store today and fell in love . they fit/drape beautifully and are incredibly comfortable while looking stylish . i 'm 5 ' 7 and 128 lbs . and the 27 ( a 4 i guess ) fit perfectly . sadly i ca n't afford them full price so will keep my eye on them in case they go on sale ."
__label__-1 "i loved the dress but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed . very easy order and return . thanks !"
__label__0 "material is a little think and they run a bit long like many other retailer pants . otherwise a great deal if you get them on sale ."
__label__0 "the pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering . the expected delivery date kept slipping . the color is not as shown online . online it looks like a light pink . the actual top was more of taupe color . it 's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom . not enough to keep ."
__label__-1 "the fabric of this top is lovely . the fit not so . it does not fit as shown on the model . the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a swing top . i am 5 ' 9 slim build . i ordered my usual size medium . shoulders and back fit perfectly . too much material around the middle . had it had a straight cut to it as shown i 'd keep it . because it does n't it 's going back ."
__label__0 "i was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture . the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking . i 'm 5 ' 9 32c and i wear 28 size pants usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one . i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big . i probably could have gone down a size but i was n't loving it enough to try . the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp"
__label__0 "i was so disappointed when i received this top . the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture . the back is cute but not worth the awful drab actual color ."
__label__0 "wanted to love this dress as it 's perfect for transition . i 'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off . my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it . i would implore the maker to try this style again as it 's a good one unfortunately the sizing was it 's downfall ."
__label__0 "i do like the shape of this piece . it is eye catching due to the length and flattering . however if you are chesty this piece shows off more than i was comfy with and i do n't think i 've ever had that problem with retailer . in the body i needed an xs or i would be swimming in it . but up top the xs showed much too much cleavage . ( 34d 5 ' 115 ) . i 'm still keeping it but i have to watch where i wear this ."
__label__-1 "this shirt runs very large . i will be returning for a smaller size ."
__label__1 "i bought this in both the black motif and the ivory . i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size . the fabric is very comfortable and does n't wrinkle easily . it does have a flowy look to it but i did n't find that it had too much fabric . i would n't tuck it in though . i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days . the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique . i recommend the shirt ."
__label__-1 "i bought this outfit online on sale - so i only paid $ 70 but i think if i saw it in person first i probably would n't have purchased it . while the design is cute the fabric is beyond cheap . it 's not just polyester - it 's like a plastic polyester . i think if you dress it up with high heels necklace armful of bangles you can probably distract from the fabric . 5 ' 5 120lb purchased xs and it 's a little big still ."
__label__1 "this dress pops ! gorgeous colors and simple classic flowy design . i thought it ran a little big i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow . 34b for reference ."
__label__-1 "totally see through ."
__label__-1 "these are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom ! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight but these fit perfectly ( even on the looser side ) and ripped effortlessly . pretty embarrassing given the price ! bringing these back ! for reference ( if you decide to try your luck ) i am 5 ' 7 128 # and my normal size s was perfect ."
__label__1 "these crops are very well proportioned and fun . the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options . i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have . i usually need to order cropped pants in tall but these worked with the regular inseam ."
__label__0 "this shirt runs extremely large . looks boxy and unflattering ."
__label__0 "so this dress is extremely comfortable but it 's just really awkward . i am on the fence about keeping it my husband loves it and thinks i should . it just draws attention to the belly so any issues after having kids is very noticeable . not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms . very comfortable but not sure if i will keep it ."
__label__-1 "unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle ) . also there are no bra-straps holders and my bra straps did show up a lot ..."
__label__-1 "this suit did nothing for me . the top has zero support . this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested . also the top gapped in the center . it just did not fit right . the top is very thin showing everything . a light padding would make a big difference in this suit . also i could not get a good fit . as i tightened the top the back would ride up . the bottoms are ok. not renatkable"
__label__1 "great light weight sweater . perfect for spring . runs true to size . definitely will buy another color ."
__label__0 "i fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite . it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything . it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me . it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just did n't lay down well bunching out on the sides in a way i did n't find to be very flattering . so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm but 3 stars for actual fit on . alas it is going"
__label__-1 "this is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area . it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area . the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves . it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what . but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it ."
__label__1 "these pants are so soft and so comfortable ! i was absolutely in love at first sight . however i got the petite because i am 5 ' 3 and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be . i wanted them to hit right above the ankle just like the photo however they are a tad longer . i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever so i am gon na deal with the length ! !"
__label__-1 "hahaha .. this dress is hilarious ! it looks nothing like the image ! i am usually a 0/xs and 4 was the smallest size available so i ordered it . when i opened it it felt like 10 lbs of fabric . i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress . once i looked in the mirror i almost fell over laughing . the rest of the dress is huge . i do n't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone ."
__label__0 "this sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous ! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy . i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl ! this runs very small ."
__label__0 "beautiful top i love the peplum . the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace . i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it 's going back ."
__label__0 "super cute skirt . i decided to return it because i felt like i did't have enough tops to go with it ."
__label__-1 "i tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger . but it 's basically cut for model-sized people only . it 's short and wide and if you have any boobs at all it 'll make the back pucker . i ca n't imagine this will look good on most women ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewer about the great colors but when i took this off the rack to try one you can see through both layers of fabric . i thought insulting quality for the price . i imagine the holes would start after one wearing ."
__label__1 "i got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect . looks great and is very comfy . low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages . i got it in a small small ."
__label__1 "i like to have a capsule wardrobe for all seasons so that when i travel or just for everyday i have a multitude of options with a few good quality pieces . i am not a fan of 'dry clean only ' items so anything that i can find that i can at least hand wash with good results and is within my color palette and sense of style is always a great find . this light weight cardi can work for multiple seasons easily it is a tad boxy but it actually works for me ( 5 ' 4 34c 125 lbs ) i can wear it with a c"
__label__-1 "regretfully this dress is on its way back for an exchange . the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size i ordered it in both colors however the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom . again the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching pulls or tears for an exchange but i ca n't pay 130 for a dress that is already torn ."
__label__1 "the label says 100 % linen but it 's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen . it 's not a scratchy linen at all . it 's a very very fine knit but the top is not sheer . i do not think you need a cami under it . i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown . it has a slight drape but it 's not really baggy at all . i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is . it 's a bit darker and has a silver essence also . i liked this so much i just bought another one in mauve ."
__label__0 "this top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy . however if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute . i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough . i wish that it had worked because it is so unique ."
__label__-1 "i was really excited about this sweater but the fit was terrible . the sleeves were the right size but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape . they must have clipped the sweater on the model . for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in both an extra small and a small ... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width but was shorter in length than i would 've liked ( if it shrunk at all it would 've been unwearable ) . the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked but i decided to keep that one . the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i"
__label__1 "i absolutely love the print . it 's what caught my eye first when scrolling down the page . the fabric is very soft single layer . the model definitely makes this shirt look slimmer or tighter to the body than the shirt actually is . the slimmer fit was the next thing i was looking forward to but like other reviews it is very flowy and the fabric falls away from the bottom below the bust ( which i 'm not mad about when wearing this in the summer -- the occasional breeze will feel nicer with a loose to"
__label__0 "the shirt is nice but not as nice a material as i was hoping but i kept it anyway . but after washing it it is even more disappointing not very soft and now kind of an odd length . hopefully it will grow on me but would n't recommend it especially for the price ."
__label__0 "really wanted to like this top . the model has it on backwards - the v is actually the back and closes with an eye hook ( that is where the tag is ? there 's also a seam running down the back ) . the front is actually a high round neck . the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap . i 'm usually a s or xs . in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely . the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up ."
__label__-1 "i love anything orange- when i saw this coat online i ordered it as i loved all the features . the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package . i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away . i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made . i ended up returning this jacket ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this skirt . i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model ; it was not so flattering on me . the fabric is so lovely -- truly the photos online do n't do it justice . it 's heavy and luxurious wonderful for fall or winter and the gold gray and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold . plus pockets ! however the midi length did not work for me despite the product 's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length just above the knee . i 'm not"

__label__0 "this blazer is a nice weight for summer . it is more terracotta than rose but is still a nice color . the fit is tts and flattering . however the buttons were almost falling off the one i received . i did n't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it ."
__label__-1 "quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it 's way around one leg ! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs . nice pant but not for this girl !"
__label__-1 "the black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips emphasizing them . the pants are sheer . the fabric was not comfortable against my skin . overall the pants were a miss ."
__label__-1 "do not waste your money on this . at first i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it . so i bought this pants in store too . i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless . i was so shock . fyi i did not use bleach or chrolox i mean i don '' t use them.i will return them both . still mad . this is bad quality enough worth it ."
__label__0 "this is a beautiful tunic . i wanted it to work so much but i could n't get past the itch factor . also the sleeves were shorter than i expected . when i wore a light tee underneath it did n't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store . if the material does n't bother you buy this . would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots ."
__label__0 "recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling"
__label__1 "the embroidery on this was beautiful but did n't hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body ."
__label__-1 "i have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago . i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress . the fit and style of this dress is wonderful it 's the color that killed it for me . i ordered the orange because i liked the photo on the model . when the dress arrived in the mail i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on . the color is almost neon orange . too much for this redhead . hard to wear that bright neony color . not sure"
__label__1 "comfortable relaxed fit . i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well !"
__label__-1 "i loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd . it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom . for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy ."
__label__0 "i wish this fit more to the body it really does flare out a lot a adding volume to the person wearing it . the mustard color is beautiful so is the pink ( i ordered both to compare ) . but the 00 was still big on me ( and p ) . so i passed . fabric is light for summer so if you are thin not muscular perhaps that would look great ?"
__label__0 "i ordered this dress online in order to get a petite size and am very disappointed . as other reviewers have mentioned the fabric overlay is very different in person than it appears in the online pictures . the dress is much more casual and looks cheaply made in person . as for sizing i ordered the 2p based on other reviewers ' comments about it running small . the 2p fit me fine although it was very fitted in the chest and i am very small chested # 32b # . i can definitely see that being an issue"
__label__1 "a truly gorgeous dress . ran a little too small in the shoulders for me so i had to reorder the next size up . its is very long but i wo n't hesitate to have it altered . it is stunning !"
__label__-1 "the tank looks nothing like the one pictured mainly because it 's tissue-paper thin . also i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit . i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large . the armholes hit halfway to my waist . obviously i did n't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned ."
__label__-1 "i ca n't believe how small this thing runs . beyond small . it 's almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work but there 's no way it 's going to when the l is actually a s. so sad to return this beauty ."
__label__1 "this skirt is gorgeous- the picture does n't do it justice . it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material . i received tons of compliments on it . the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily . in a short 2 hours of wearing it the material was already pulled in two different places . i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time ."
__label__-1 "loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding . unfortunately the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else . it fit well but was poorly made . based off other reviews this is n't the first time this has happened with this dress ! not worth the risk at all ."
__label__1 "i consider myself fairly busty ( 34 d ) but i did n't have any problems wearing my normal size small/medium ..... i actually went with the small . the lace inset does n't give but it was n't tight at all . i love the flow of the blouse .... it is going to be a great transitional piece into fall !"

__label__1 "this is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale ! trust the other reviewers that it does run small ! i am normally a 0 or 2 on top and i got the 4 - and it 's a bit snug ! it is very fitted below the bust but that 's what makes it look so nice on . i would definitely recommend but know that sizing is off ."

__label__0 "i really liked this dress in so many ways . i 'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me . however the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut . it is n't that obvious in the photos but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me and it was too expensive to keep something that 's unflattering . too bad if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run . lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets ."
__label__-1 "this looks so cute ... but do n't be fooled . it is so poofy . it does not look in real life like it does on the model . it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous . i was so disappointed ."
__label__0 "i love the quality and colors of this romper ; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style . it made the bottom part pull as well . overall the fit just was n't right for me . i did love the material and it is a very nice piece ."

__label__0 "very high quality dress . there are two layers ( the under navy and over white crochet ) which makes this worth the price . however it is very straight making the dress fit like a bag if you have hips or boobs . tried petite and regular and both were too baggy even in xs ."
__label__-1 "i 'm upset . i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper the picture of the grey does not have a zipper . i prefer no zipper so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper i was disappointed . it 's going back . why have a model where an item that you 're not offering ? ? ?"
__label__1 "i already have some dresses similar to this but i could n't help getting this one too . i love the flowers bees and ladybugs on the print ! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots . i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket so i 'll get more use out of it . it 's a lovely light floaty fabric that 's nice for warmer weather ."
__label__0 "i 'm very pale and on me the rose color looked really washed out . the catalog photo is not an accurate representation . look at the product shot for a truer representation . it 's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin . i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin though ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress and was hoping to keep it . but for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy . i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips ."
__label__1 "cute and comfy shirt ! tts- got my usual m ( i 'm a 10 ) and it has a generous fit but i think it 's supposed to . it 's actually a silver grey color ."
__label__1 "these pants are beautiful and so comfortable . the liner is a nice surprise . they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket . i 'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale !"
__label__-1 "runs very large and way too much fabric . i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger . i usually wear s/m and the xs had too much fabric . may work better on someone with longer torso and taller . i am 5 ' 6.5 36c 126lbs"
